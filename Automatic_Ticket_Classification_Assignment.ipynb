    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to build a model that is able to classify customer complaints based on the products/services. By doing so, you can segregate these tickets into their relevant categories and, therefore, help in the quick resolution of the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be doing topic modelling on the <b>.json</b> data provided by the company. Since this data is not labelled, you need to apply NMF to analyse patterns and classify tickets into the following five clusters based on their products/services:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Credit card / Prepaid card\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bank account services\n",
    "\n",
    "* Theft/Dispute reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mortgages/loans\n",
    "\n",
    "* Others\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With the help of topic modelling, you will be able to map each ticket onto its respective department/category. You can then use this data to train any supervised model such as logistic regression, decision tree or random forest. Using this trained model, you can classify any new customer complaint support ticket into its relevant department."

restricted my account by my debit card tuesday xx xx    on thursday xx xx   i went into a branch after being advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed  i went into the branch to see how i can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned  the bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would post but they may take an additional business day  that saturday i attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on friday  xx xx    upon looking at my account i realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement  ive been called and i was told that it may take two business day stating tuesday  xx xx xxxx would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only  now  chase is informing me that i will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently  unfortunately  this has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments  etc  i am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself  although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document  i am not being a shored or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself  although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document  this situation is truly affecting my livelihood and they dont

around noon today xx xx   and was asked the last   numbers of my chase savings account and the other user on my account  i responded that i did not have a savings and i am only authorized user  customer rep told me they would call me back in   minutes to keep the line open  i didnt receive a call back after an hour so i contacted chase  from the first call i thought someone was using my card fraudulently  i spoke to the rep who transferred me to a supervisor xxxx who said the card was activated and the transaction would process  called the catering company and card was declined  i then used my xxxx  xxxx card to pay for the order  xxxx xxxx texted me asking if i was authorizing purchase and i responded yes  contacted caterer and xxxx  xxxx was declined  i contacted chase again spoke to rep was told the initial questions are used to trick people to see what there answer would be  she told me the cvv code was incorrectly being input by the caterer and i responded that i had gone over the numbers and cvv used was correct  she told me the card was cleared for the purchase and she would monitor it for   hours  called caterer   card declined  use a mastercard  which processed  went to use chase amazon at restaurant at xxxx pm tonight in the amount of          it was declined  i was told by chase i was not over limit  still frustrated figuring out multiple declines after several conversations with chase stating the card would be ok to use  embarrassed as the caterer kept suggesting i was over my limit which i pay my card in full every month and chase confirmed that i was under my limit with the        transaction  never been declined by either chase or xxxx  xxxx before   today after multiple assurances that i was all set and card would be monitored to make sure transaction would clear   it never did   \n",

website  i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation  product  or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank  \\n\\ni contacted chase via a secured message on xx xx   explaining what happened and asked   is there a way to reverse this transaction  or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient     that xxxx  my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that   the transfer has been completed  however  as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email  some require the expertise of another team  in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team     i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department  i was directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer  i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didn t have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask xxxx or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for  \\n\\ni called xxxx who s automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction  i called xxxx again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent  they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase  s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction  she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation  i ended the call and called chase again  \\n\\nwhen i called chase the second time  the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information  she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again  i was once again transferred to the claims department  who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i was looking for  after i told her that i had already contacted them  she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured  she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system  in both phone calls  they asked if i initiated that transaction  and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter  \\n\\nduring this whole process  it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation  these transactions are advertised as a   fast  safe and easy way to send money     but seem to be a dangerous way to do business  i feel deceived by chase  s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team    \n",

i came across an offer for        to be applied towards the ticket if i applied for a rewards card  i put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute  was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made  i immediately contacted xxxx and was referred to chase bank  i then immediately contacted chase bank within no more than   of getting the notification on the screen and i was told by the chase representative i spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why  i asked for more information about the xxxx  offer and she explained that even if i had been approved  the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket  i then explicitly told her i was glad i got denied and i was absolutely no longer interested in the account  i asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged  this all happened no later than   after putting in the application on xx xx    notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what i was told by the chase representative  chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on xx xx    this is now being reported in my credit report and chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which i did not consent to and out of their error    \n",

 on xx xx xxxx  i made payments of        on xx xx xxxx and        on xx xx xxxx  the minimum payment was         the closing date was xx xx xxxx   please see attached statement    that statement   xx xx xxxx   shows that i had an outstanding purchase balance of        on xx xx xxxx  i have enclosed the previous months statement to show that there were no other purchases prior to the one on xx xx xxxx  \\nhowever  when i got the xxxx statement  it shows that i still have a purchase balance of         i have a promotional balance   xxxx   in xxxx of         in xxxx  the promotional balance was          a difference of         \\n\\napparently  the payment   above the minimum payment required by chase   i thought would be applied to the purchase            was applied to the promotional balance first  it is my understanding that once the minimum payment has been met  payments in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first  this is not the first time that chase has skirted us financial law to turn a larger profit  i need help in rectifying this problem  because my logic fell on deaf ears at chase  thank you in advance for your assistance

                                                      i recently called to ask chase bank why they reported to the credit bureau that i was   days late on a payment that was already paid off  when i called i got this info   they showed that on the xxxx of xx xx   i was very late on my bill and owed xxxx to bring this balance down to xxxx and be finished with the bill  i paid that amount on the same day the xxxx to being it to xxxx  \\n\\nthey say that i tried to make another payment for        later that same day and in a few days that came back as a return payment  \\n\\nthe man on the phone stated to me that if the payment went through then it would have meant that i had a credit on my account for xxxx since i didnt owe anything  \\n\\nthey updated my account with charges and late fees from the return payment that i had no idea of since i thought i paid off the entire amount  they reported to the credit bureau that i was   days late for not paying what accrued to be        the guy representing chase agreed with me that they were in the wrong for charging me the fees and said they would remove them  i still have        in the negative that they are saying that i owe in the mobile app  \\n\\nadditionally  because they reported me being late my credit score dropped   points  when i called back to ask if they can report that they made a mistake they said i would have to do that on my own  i think that s xxxx    \n",

                                   on more than one occasion my bank   chase   has charged me multiple overdraft fees towards my account  and it has to do with the way they process charges as they hit my account  they will take the largest item first  which will overdraw my account  and then charge smaller items afterwards  back on xx xx xxxx  this very same thing happened  we had a balance of        and i had   charges come in to my accountone for         one for        and another for         the bank ran all of these in that order and subsequently charged me   overdraft fees in the amount of        each  when i called to complain about this practice they said they do it that way because they feel that larger items are more important items like house payments  car payments  etc  the bank has reimbursed us before for this practice  but told me this is a one time courtesy and will not do it again  \\nhad those charges been done in reverse order  we would have had only one charge  in my opinion  as well as the rep from your agency  this is a shady business practice and a way for a bank to make more money off of people struggling to make it through until payday   \\nand this continues to happen to this day   \n",

payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with xxxx on the chase website i realized that this wa a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiry regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailer bank i contacted chase via a secured message on xx xx explaining what happened and asked is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient that xxxx my message wa reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that the transfer ha been completed however a you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiry by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regard to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claim department i wa directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent wa trying to get me to end the call a quickly a possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didn t have an opportunity to get any information about what the right question would be to ask xxxx or what word and phrase i should use to get the information i wa looking for i called xxxx who s automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the bank app to initiate the transaction i called xxxx again to navigate their menu and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the bank app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i wa once again transferred to the claim department who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i wa looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there wa nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these type of transaction are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipient banking information wa not kept in the system in both phone call they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regard to this matter during this whole process it felt like chase wa not transparent about their policy regarding these type of transaction nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transaction are advertised a a fast safe and easy way to send money but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i wa treated by the member on their customer service team   \n",

transaction if needed but chase always changed the order and charged me overdraft fee anyway when you call they said their per their guideline they don t refund more then overdrawft doesn t matter

xx xxxx please see attached statement that statement xx xx xxxx show that i had an outstanding purchase balance of on xx xx xxxx i have enclosed the previous month statement to show that there were no other purchase prior to the one on xx xx xxxx however when i got the xxxx statement it show that i still have a purchase balance of i have a promotional balance xxxx in xxxx of in xxxx the promotional balance wa a difference of apparently the payment above the minimum payment required by chase i thought would be applied to the purchase wa applied to the promotional balance first it is my understanding that once the minimum payment ha been met payment in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first this is not the first time that chase ha skirted u financial law to turn a larger profit i need help in rectifying this problem because my logic fell on deaf ear at chase thank you in advance for your assistance respectfully xxxx xxxx xxxx   \n",

already paid off when i called i got this info they showed that on the xxxx of xx xx i wa very late on my bill and owed xxxx to bring this balance down to xxxx and be finished with the bill i paid that amount on the same day the xxxx to being it to xxxx they say that i tried to make another payment for later that same day and in a few day that came back a a return payment the man on the phone stated to me that if the payment went through then it would have meant that i had a credit on my account for xxxx since i didnt owe anything they updated my account with charge and late fee from the return payment that i had no idea of since i thought i paid off the entire amount they reported to the credit bureau that i wa day late for not paying what accrued to be the guy representing chase agreed with me that they were in the wrong for charging me the fee and said they would remove them i still have in the negative that they are saying that i owe in the mobile app additionally because they reported me being late my credit score dropped point when i called back to ask if they can report that they made a mistake they said i would have to do that on my own i think that s xxxx   \n",

way they process charge a they hit my account they will take the largest item first which will overdraw my account and then charge smaller item afterwards back on xx xx xxxx this very same thing happened we had a balance of and i had charge come in to my accountone for one for and another for the bank ran all of these in that order and subsequently charged me overdraft fee in the amount of each when i called to complain about this practice they said they do it that way because they feel that larger item are more important item like house payment car payment etc the bank ha reimbursed u before for this practice but told me this is a one time courtesy and will not do it again had those charge been done in reverse order we would have had only one charge in my opinion a well a the rep from your agency this is a shady business practice and a way for a bank to make more money off of people struggling to make it through until payday and this continues to happen to this day   \n",

i came across an offer for        to be applied towards the ticket if i applied for a rewards card  i put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute  was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made  i immediately contacted xxxx and was referred to chase bank  i then immediately contacted chase bank within no more than   of getting the notification on the screen and i was told by the chase representative i spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why  i asked for more information about the xxxx  offer and she explained that even if i had been approved  the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket  i then explicitly told her i was glad i got denied and i was absolutely no longer interested in the account  i asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged  this all happened no later than   after putting in the application on xx xx    notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what i was told by the chase representative  chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on xx xx    this is now being reported in my credit report and chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which i did not consent to and out of their error    \n",

restricted my account by my debit card tuesday xx xx    on thursday xx xx   i went into a branch after being advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed  i went into the branch to see how i can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned  the bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would post but they may take an additional business day  that saturday i attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on friday  xx xx    upon looking at my account i realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement  ive been called and i was told that it may take two business day stating tuesday  xx xx xxxx would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only  now  chase is informing me that i will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently  unfortunately  this has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments  etc  i am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself  although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document  i am not being a shored or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself  although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document  this situation is truly affecting my livelihood and they dont

website  i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation  product  or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank  \\n\\ni contacted chase via a secured message on xx xx   explaining what happened and asked   is there a way to reverse this transaction  or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient     that xxxx  my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that   the transfer has been completed  however  as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email  some require the expertise of another team  in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team     i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department  i was directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer  i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didn t have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask xxxx or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for  \\n\\ni called xxxx who s automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction  i called xxxx again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent  they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase  s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction  she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation  i ended the call and called chase again  \\n\\nwhen i called chase the second time  the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information  she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again  i was once again transferred to the claims department  who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i was looking for  after i told her that i had already contacted them  she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured  she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system  in both phone calls  they asked if i initiated that transaction  and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter  \\n\\nduring this whole process  it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation  these transactions are advertised as a   fast  safe and easy way to send money     but seem to be a dangerous way to do business  i feel deceived by chase  s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team    \n",

      i opened an account with chase bank on xxxx and used a code for xxxx bonus  i called to follow up on xx xx xxxx about the terms and was told everything was on the account and once i made xxxx direct deposit the bonus would be paid out in   days  as of xxxx i had made the required deposits and was told my account never had the coupon code applied and it was past the   days to do so  so no bonus would be paid    \n",

                                                  to whom it may concern  chase bank charged wrongly overdraft fees  i have alert of low balance or unsuficent fee balance and always deposit immediatly to cover transactions if needed but chase always changed the order and charged me overdraft fee anyway  when you call they said their per their guidelines they don t refund more then   overdrawft doesn t matter bank fault or not \\n\\ntaken        from people is money just because you can is not ok \\n\\nsee attached documents  when chase refund  they always find the way to take back what they refunded in first place    \n",

around noon today xx xx   and was asked the last   numbers of my chase savings account and the other user on my account  i responded that i did not have a savings and i am only authorized user  customer rep told me they would call me back in   minutes to keep the line open  i didnt receive a call back after an hour so i contacted chase  from the first call i thought someone was using my card fraudulently  i spoke to the rep who transferred me to a supervisor xxxx who said the card was activated and the transaction would process  called the catering company and card was declined  i then used my xxxx  xxxx card to pay for the order  xxxx xxxx texted me asking if i was authorizing purchase and i responded yes  contacted caterer and xxxx  xxxx was declined  i contacted chase again spoke to rep was told the initial questions are used to trick people to see what there answer would be  she told me the cvv code was incorrectly being input by the caterer and i responded that i had gone over the numbers and cvv used was correct  she told me the card was cleared for the purchase and she would monitor it for   hours  called caterer   card declined  use a mastercard  which processed  went to use chase amazon at restaurant at xxxx pm tonight in the amount of          it was declined  i was told by chase i was not over limit  still frustrated figuring out multiple declines after several conversations with chase stating the card would be ok to use  embarrassed as the caterer kept suggesting i was over my limit which i pay my card in full every month and chase confirmed that i was under my limit with the        transaction  never been declined by either chase or xxxx  xxxx before   today after multiple assurances that i was all set and card would be monitored to make sure transaction would clear   it never did   \n",

 on xx xx xxxx  i made payments of        on xx xx xxxx and        on xx xx xxxx  the minimum payment was         the closing date was xx xx xxxx   please see attached statement    that statement   xx xx xxxx   shows that i had an outstanding purchase balance of        on xx xx xxxx  i have enclosed the previous months statement to show that there were no other purchases prior to the one on xx xx xxxx  \\nhowever  when i got the xxxx statement  it shows that i still have a purchase balance of         i have a promotional balance   xxxx   in xxxx of         in xxxx  the promotional balance was          a difference of         \\n\\napparently  the payment   above the minimum payment required by chase   i thought would be applied to the purchase            was applied to the promotional balance first  it is my understanding that once the minimum payment has been met  payments in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first  this is not the first time that chase has skirted us financial law to turn a larger profit  i need help in rectifying this problem  because my logic fell on deaf ears at chase  thank you in advance for your assistance

                                                      i recently called to ask chase bank why they reported to the credit bureau that i was   days late on a payment that was already paid off  when i called i got this info   they showed that on the xxxx of xx xx   i was very late on my bill and owed xxxx to bring this balance down to xxxx and be finished with the bill  i paid that amount on the same day the xxxx to being it to xxxx  \\n\\nthey say that i tried to make another payment for        later that same day and in a few days that came back as a return payment  \\n\\nthe man on the phone stated to me that if the payment went through then it would have meant that i had a credit on my account for xxxx since i didnt owe anything  \\n\\nthey updated my account with charges and late fees from the return payment that i had no idea of since i thought i paid off the entire amount  they reported to the credit bureau that i was   days late for not paying what accrued to be        the guy representing chase agreed with me that they were in the wrong for charging me the fees and said they would remove them  i still have        in the negative that they are saying that i owe in the mobile app  \\n\\nadditionally  because they reported me being late my credit score dropped   points  when i called back to ask if they can report that they made a mistake they said i would have to do that on my own  i think that s xxxx    \n",

                                   on more than one occasion my bank   chase   has charged me multiple overdraft fees towards my account  and it has to do with the way they process charges as they hit my account  they will take the largest item first  which will overdraw my account  and then charge smaller items afterwards  back on xx xx xxxx  this very same thing happened  we had a balance of        and i had   charges come in to my accountone for         one for        and another for         the bank ran all of these in that order and subsequently charged me   overdraft fees in the amount of        each  when i called to complain about this practice they said they do it that way because they feel that larger items are more important items like house payments  car payments  etc  the bank has reimbursed us before for this practice  but told me this is a one time courtesy and will not do it again  \\nhad those charges been done in reverse order  we would have had only one charge  in my opinion  as well as the rep from your agency  this is a shady business practice and a way for a bank to make more money off of people struggling to make it through until payday   \\nand this continues to happen to this day   \n",

i came across an offer for to be applied towards the ticket if i applied for a reward card i put in my information for the offer and within le than a minute wa notified via the screen that a decision could not be made i immediately contacted xxxx and wa referred to chase bank i then immediately contacted chase bank within no more than of getting the notification on the screen and i wa told by the chase representative i spoke with that my application wa denied but she could not state why i asked for more information about the xxxx offer and she explained that even if i had been approved the credit offer only get applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket i then explicitly told her i wa glad i got denied and i wa absolutely no longer interested in the account i asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged this all happened no later than after putting in the application on xx xx notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what i wa told by the chase representative chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on xx xx this is now being reported in my credit report and chase ha refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which i did not consent to and out of their error   \n",

payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with xxxx on the chase website i realized that this wa a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiry regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailer bank i contacted chase via a secured message on xx xx explaining what happened and asked is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient that xxxx my message wa reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that the transfer ha been completed however a you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiry by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regard to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claim department i wa directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent wa trying to get me to end the call a quickly a possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didn t have an opportunity to get any information about what the right question would be to ask xxxx or what word and phrase i should use to get the information i wa looking for i called xxxx who s automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the bank app to initiate the transaction i called xxxx again to navigate their menu and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the bank app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i wa once again transferred to the claim department who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i wa looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there wa nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these type of transaction are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipient banking information wa not kept in the system in both phone call they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regard to this matter during this whole process it felt like chase wa not transparent about their policy regarding these type of transaction nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transaction are advertised a a fast safe and easy way to send money but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i wa treated by the member on their customer service team   \n",

                                   to whom it may concern chase bank charged wrongly overdraft fee i have alert of low balance or unsuficent fee balance and always deposit immediatly to cover transaction if needed but chase always changed the order and charged me overdraft fee anyway when you call they said their per their guideline they don t refund more then overdrawft doesn t matter bank fault or not taken from people is money just because you can is not ok see attached document when chase refund they always find the way to take back what they refunded in first place   \n",

xx xxxx please see attached statement that statement xx xx xxxx show that i had an outstanding purchase balance of on xx xx xxxx i have enclosed the previous month statement to show that there were no other purchase prior to the one on xx xx xxxx however when i got the xxxx statement it show that i still have a purchase balance of i have a promotional balance xxxx in xxxx of in xxxx the promotional balance wa a difference of apparently the payment above the minimum payment required by chase i thought would be applied to the purchase wa applied to the promotional balance first it is my understanding that once the minimum payment ha been met payment in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first this is not the first time that chase ha skirted u financial law to turn a larger profit i need help in rectifying this problem because my logic fell on deaf ear at chase thank you in advance for your assistance respectfully xxxx xxxx xxxx   \n",

that amount on the same day the xxxx to being it to xxxx they say that i tried to make another payment for later that same day and in a few day that came back a a return payment the man on the phone stated to me that if the payment went through then it would have meant that i had a credit on my account for xxxx since i didnt owe anything they updated my account with charge and late fee from the return payment that i had no idea of since i thought i paid off the entire amount they reported to the credit bureau that i wa day late for not paying what accrued to be the guy representing chase agreed with me that they were in the wrong for charging me the fee and said they would remove them i still have in the negative that they are saying that i owe in the mobile app additionally because they reported me being late my credit score dropped point when i called back to ask if they can report that they made a mistake they said i would have to do that on my own i think that s xxxx   \n",

way they process charge a they hit my account they will take the largest item first which will overdraw my account and then charge smaller item afterwards back on xx xx xxxx this very same thing happened we had a balance of and i had charge come in to my accountone for one for and another for the bank ran all of these in that order and subsequently charged me overdraft fee in the amount of each when i called to complain about this practice they said they do it that way because they feel that larger item are more important item like house payment car payment etc the bank ha reimbursed u before for this practice but told me this is a one time courtesy and will not do it again had those charge been done in reverse order we would have had only one charge in my opinion a well a the rep from your agency this is a shady business practice and a way for a bank to make more money off of people struggling to make it through until payday and this continues to happen to this day   \n",

me at the number on file xxxx mid xxxx my case wa assigned to xxxx in the executive office we spent roughly week before either one of u spoke on the phone although she had left a handful of voicemail i first spoke with xxxx on friday xx xx xxxx i told her about the multiple claim that were opened against an account i had since closed she claimed she only received two of the claim against the account after speaking with me she assured me she wa going to investigate all the claim made that were made beginning at the end of xxxx on xx xx xxxx i noticed multiple payment being deducted from my chase checking account in the description all i saw were number on xx xx xxxx i called xxxx to see why money wa being debited from my account of course all i got wa xxxx s voicemail i left a message requesting a return call by xx xx xxxx i still had not received a return call i called xxxx once again because money wa still being debited from my account this time i got a hold of xxxx her explanation for the debited fund wa a bit odd she told me that while they were investigating these open claim money wa still going to be debited and there wa nothing she could do about it finally on xx xx xxxx i received a voicemail from xxxx to call her a soon a possible i returned her call once school wa dismissed for the day it wa at that point that xxxx told me they closed their investigation of my claim and decided not to reverse their decision when asked what research they used to complete their investigation xxxx became short and told me i would have to subpoena the information at that point i hung up because i felt that it wa a lose lose situation</td>\n",

i came across an offer for        to be applied towards the ticket if i applied for a rewards card  i put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute  was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made  i immediately contacted xxxx and was referred to chase bank  i then immediately contacted chase bank within no more than   of getting the notification on the screen and i was told by the chase representative i spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why  i asked for more information about the xxxx  offer and she explained that even if i had been approved  the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket  i then explicitly told her i was glad i got denied and i was absolutely no longer interested in the account  i asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged  this all happened no later than   after putting in the application on xx xx    notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what i was told by the chase representative  chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on xx xx    this is now being reported in my credit report and chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which i did not

restricted my account by my debit card tuesday xx xx    on thursday xx xx   i went into a branch after being advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed  i went into the branch to see how i can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned  the bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would post but they may take an additional business day  that saturday i attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on friday  xx xx    upon looking at my account i realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement  ive been called and i was told that it may take two business day stating tuesday  xx xx xxxx would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only  now  chase is informing me that i will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently  unfortunately  this has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments  etc  i am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself  although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document  i am not being a shored or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself  although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document  this situation is truly affecting my livelihood and they dont seem to want to deal with me professionally  thank you   \n",

website  i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation  product  or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank  \\n\\ni contacted chase via a secured message on xx xx   explaining what happened and asked   is there a way to reverse this transaction  or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient     that xxxx  my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that   the transfer has been completed  however  as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email  some require the expertise of another team  in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team     i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department  i was directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer  i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didn t have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask xxxx or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for  \\n\\ni called xxxx who s automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction  i called xxxx again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent  they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase  s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction  she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation  i ended the call and called chase again  \\n\\nwhen i called chase the second time  the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information  she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again  i was once again transferred to the claims department  who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i was looking for  after i told her that i had already contacted them  she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured  she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system  in both phone calls  they asked if i initiated that transaction  and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter  \\n\\nduring this whole process  it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation  these transactions are advertised as a   fast  safe and easy way to send money     but seem to be a dangerous way to do business  i feel deceived by chase  s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team    \n",

      i opened an account with chase bank on xxxx and used a code for xxxx bonus  i called to follow up on xx xx xxxx about the terms and was told everything was on the account and once i made xxxx direct deposit the bonus would be paid out in   days  as of xxxx i had made the required deposits and was told my account never had the coupon code applied and it was past the   days to do so  so no bonus would be paid    \n",

                                                  to whom it may concern  chase bank charged wrongly overdraft fees  i have alert of low balance or unsuficent fee balance and always deposit immediatly to cover transactions if needed but chase always changed the order and charged me overdraft fee anyway  when you call they said their per their guidelines they don t refund more then   overdrawft doesn t matter bank fault or not \\n\\ntaken        from people is money just because you can is not ok \\n\\nsee attached documents  when chase refund  they always find the way to take back what they refunded in first place    \n",

around noon today xx xx   and was asked the last   numbers of my chase savings account and the other user on my account  i responded that i did not have a savings and i am only authorized user  customer rep told me they would call me back in   minutes to keep the line open  i didnt receive a call back after an hour so i contacted chase  from the first call i thought someone was using my card fraudulently  i spoke to the rep who transferred me to a supervisor xxxx who said the card was activated and the transaction would process  called the catering company and card was declined  i then used my xxxx  xxxx card to pay for the order  xxxx xxxx texted me asking if i was authorizing purchase and i responded yes  contacted caterer and xxxx  xxxx was declined  i contacted chase again spoke to rep was told the initial questions are used to trick people to see what there answer would be  she told me the cvv code was incorrectly being input by the caterer and i responded that i had gone over the numbers and cvv used was correct  she told me the card was cleared for the purchase and she would monitor it for   hours  called caterer   card declined  use a mastercard  which processed  went to use chase amazon at restaurant at xxxx pm tonight in the amount of          it was declined  i was told by chase i was not over limit  still frustrated figuring out multiple declines after several conversations with chase stating the card would be ok to use  embarrassed as the caterer kept suggesting i was over my limit which i pay my card in full every month and chase confirmed that i was under my limit with the        transaction  never been declined by either chase or xxxx  xxxx before   today after multiple assurances that i was all set and card would be monitored to make sure transaction would clear   it never did   \n",

 on xx xx xxxx  i made payments of        on xx xx xxxx and        on xx xx xxxx  the minimum payment was         the closing date was xx xx xxxx   please see attached statement    that statement   xx xx xxxx   shows that i had an outstanding purchase balance of        on xx xx xxxx  i have enclosed the previous months statement to show that there were no other purchases prior to the one on xx xx xxxx  \\nhowever  when i got the xxxx statement  it shows that i still have a purchase balance of         i have a promotional balance   xxxx   in xxxx of         in xxxx  the promotional balance was          a difference of         \\n\\napparently  the payment   above the minimum payment required by chase   i thought would be applied to the purchase            was applied to the promotional balance first  it is my understanding that once the minimum payment has been met  payments in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first  this is not the first

                                                      i recently called to ask chase bank why they reported to the credit bureau that i was   days late on a payment that was already paid off  when i called i got this info   they showed that on the xxxx of xx xx   i was very late on my bill and owed xxxx to bring this balance down to xxxx and be finished with the bill  i paid that amount on the same day the xxxx to being it to xxxx  \\n\\nthey say that i tried to make another payment for        later that same day and in a few days that came back as a return payment  \\n\\nthe man on the phone stated to me that if the payment went through then it would have meant that i had a credit on my account for xxxx since i didnt owe anything  \\n\\nthey updated my account with charges and late fees from the return payment that i had no idea of since i thought i paid off the entire amount  they reported to the credit bureau that i was   days late for not paying what accrued to be        the guy representing chase agreed with me that they were in the wrong for charging me the fees and said they would remove them  i still have        in the negative that they are saying that i owe in the mobile app  \\n\\nadditionally  because they reported me being late my credit score dropped   points  when i called back to ask if they can report that they made a mistake they said i would have to do that on my own  i think that s xxxx    \n",

                                   on more than one occasion my bank   chase   has charged me multiple overdraft fees towards my account  and it has to do with the way they process charges as they hit my account  they will take the largest item first  which will overdraw my account  and then charge smaller items afterwards  back on xx xx xxxx  this very same thing happened  we had a balance of        and i had   charges come in to my accountone for         one for        and another for         the bank ran all of these in that order and subsequently charged me   overdraft fees in the amount of        each  when i called to complain about this practice they said they do it that way because they feel that larger items are more important items like house payments  car payments  etc  the bank has reimbursed us before for this practice  but told me this is a one time courtesy and will not do it again  \\nhad those charges been done in reverse order  we would have had only one charge  in my opinion  as well as the rep from your agency  this is a shady business practice and a way for a bank to make more money off of people struggling to make it through until payday   \\nand this continues to happen to this day   \n",

i came across an offer for to be applied towards the ticket if i applied for a reward card i put in my information for the offer and within le than a minute wa notified via the screen that a decision could not be made i immediately contacted xxxx and wa referred to chase bank i then immediately contacted chase bank within no more than of getting the notification on the screen and i wa told by the chase representative i spoke with that my application wa denied but she could not state why i asked for more information about the xxxx offer and she explained that even if i had been approved the credit offer only get applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket i then explicitly told her i wa glad i got denied and i wa absolutely no longer interested in the account i asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged this all happened no later than after putting in the application on xx xx notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what i wa told by the chase representative chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on xx xx this is now being reported in my

payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with xxxx on the chase website i realized that this wa a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiry regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailer bank i contacted chase via a secured message on xx xx explaining what happened and asked is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient that xxxx my message wa reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that the transfer ha been completed however a you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiry by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regard to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claim department i wa directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent wa trying to get me to end the call a quickly a possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didn t have an opportunity to get any information about what the right question would be to ask xxxx or what word and phrase i should use to get the information i wa looking for i called xxxx who s automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the bank app to initiate the transaction i called xxxx again to navigate their menu and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the bank app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i wa once again transferred to the claim department who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i wa looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there wa nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these type of transaction are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipient banking information wa not kept in the system in both phone call they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regard to this matter during this whole process it felt like chase wa not transparent about their policy regarding these type of transaction nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transaction are advertised a a fast safe and easy way to send money but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i wa treated by the member on

                                   to whom it may concern chase bank charged wrongly overdraft fee i have alert of low balance or unsuficent fee balance and always deposit immediatly to cover transaction if needed but chase always changed the order and charged me overdraft fee anyway when you call they said their per their guideline they don t refund more then overdrawft doesn t matter bank fault or not taken from people is money just because you can is not ok see attached document when chase refund they always find the way to take back what they refunded in first place   \n",

xx xxxx please see attached statement that statement xx xx xxxx show that i had an outstanding purchase balance of on xx xx xxxx i have enclosed the previous month statement to show that there were no other purchase prior to the one on xx xx xxxx however when i got the xxxx statement it show that i still have a purchase balance of i have a promotional balance xxxx in xxxx of in xxxx the promotional balance wa a difference of apparently the payment above the minimum payment required by chase i thought would be applied to the purchase wa applied to the promotional balance first it is my understanding that once the minimum payment ha been met payment in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first this is not the first time that chase ha skirted u financial law to turn a larger profit i need help in rectifying this problem because my logic fell on deaf ear at chase thank you in advance for your assistance respectfully xxxx xxxx xxxx   \n",

stated to me that if the payment went through then it would have meant that i had a credit on my account for xxxx since i didnt owe anything they updated my account with charge and late fee from the return payment that i had no idea of since i thought i paid off the entire amount they reported to the credit bureau that i wa day late for not paying what accrued to be the guy representing chase

way they process charge a they hit my account they will take the largest item first which will overdraw my account and then charge smaller item afterwards back on xx xx xxxx this very same thing happened we had a balance of and i had charge come in to my accountone for one for and another for the bank ran all of these in that order and subsequently charged me overdraft fee in the amount of each when i called to complain about this practice they said they do it that way because they feel that larger item are more important item like house payment car payment etc the bank ha reimbursed u before for this practice but told me this is a one time courtesy and will not do it again had those charge been done in reverse order we would have had only one charge in my opinion a well a the rep from your agency this is a shady business practice and a way for a bank to make more money off of people struggling to make it through until payday and this continues to happen to this day   \n",
